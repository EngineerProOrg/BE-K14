/*another way to solve this problem is to create a table 
that holds the pre calculation of the number of bank accounts for each category.*/
SELECT "Low Salary" AS category,
       sum(income < 20000) AS accounts_count
  FROM Accounts

UNION

SELECT "Average Salary" AS category,
       sum(income BETWEEN 20000 AND 50000) AS accounts_count
  FROM Accounts

UNION

SELECT "High Salary" AS category,
       sum(income > 50000) AS accounts_count
  FROM Accounts;
